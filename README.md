**To run this project:**

2. Run "Q_chCluster1_last.py". ("Tcase" variable in the code is equal to 'main' to produce results in "results" folder.)
3. Create a new folder and transfer all results except ".fp" files.
4. Change "Tcase" variable value to 'test' then run "Q_chCluster1_last.py" again to produce best results of each window sizes.


**NOTE!**
1. Running corpus_build.py for quranic-corpus-morphology-0.4.txt[1] creates a preprocessed text of Holy Qur'an for you.
2. $m.fp files has been achieved by running gSpan[2] software on $m files.
